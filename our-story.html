					<p>The Community Resource Center of Robertson County’s mission is to reduce health disparities and improve health status of Robertson County, TX residents by improving access to value-based services and resources. The focus is on improving the overall health of the county through case management, information and referral, service coordination, and direct client assistance.<br><br>It grew organically through the dedication of folks within Robertson County. The Texas Rural Leadership Program, which has a mission to help Texans build vibrant communities through creative vision and inclusive leadership, held a seminar locally. Some of the challenges that were identified at the time were the county’s lack of a hospital district or mental health services. Participants put together the first health fair in the county. When coordinating with the involved organizations that serve the Brazos Valley to improve well-being, it came to the attention of the organizers that there was no point of entry, or homebase, for these organizations in Robertson County, and this was an opportunity being lost.<br><br>The need was apparent, as health outcomes tended to be poor, and the rate of heart diseases, respiratory diseases, and mortality loomed far above Texas and national averages. According to the 2022 Brazos Valley Health Assessment conducted by the Texas A&amp;M University Center for Community Health Development, residents were concerned with limited employment opportunities, with a 4.9% unemployment rate, and housing disparities, as 14.4% of residents report severe housing problems. Food instability was widespread, and one town in Robertson County even lacked a food bank.<br><br>The potential was apparent as well, as residents had shown over and again that they were more than willing to reach out a hand to neighbors, such as when neighbors rallied together to help those in need of home repair after major storms or housing fires. Local churches were able to assist individuals, but a more comprehensive approach was needed.<br><br>To meet these needs and amplify the strengths of the community, and to provide a base for organizations serving the Brazos Valley, a community resource center was needed. In 2019, a major step forward to establishing one was accomplished; funds were provided by a grant through the Episcopal Health Foundation. This funding was adequate to get the program off the ground. After an extensive search in 2021, the founding members identified Tim Charron as the ideal candidate to run the program, and the center was able to be launched. In summer of 2021, the doors of the Community Resource Center were opened to serve the community members of Robertson County.</p>
